# *"Tree is All You Need"* : Predicting tree deformation using GNN

The goal for this project is to learn the complex physics model of trees. More specifically, we want to predict the deformation of trees when an external force is applied. Obtaining a more accurate model of tree is important for the robot, as it can lead to safer and more robust manipulation in agriculture. For this purpose, we use recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks and take advantage of graph-like tree structures to learn and predict the dynamics of tree deformation. We share our custom collected synthetic dataset as well as our codebase.
